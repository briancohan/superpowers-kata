# Superpowers Kata ü•ã

This repository is for my work in the [Everyday Superpowers](https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/) [Python Growth Challenge](https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/python-growth-challenge/).

My goals for this challenge are:
* Use the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) for all the code
* Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for all the testing (because no one needs to fuss with [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html))
* Use as much [typehinting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) as possible
  * Remember Python 3.9 allows use of [standard collections as types](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.9.html#type-hinting-generics-in-standard-collections)

## About Everyday Superpowers ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Everyday Superpowers is a site about providing tools to empower others in their personal and professional journey, particuarly with Python.
The website belongs to my good buddy Chris May.
He's got some good [articles](https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/) and [resources](https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/resources/) to checkout.
You should check him out on [github](https://github.com/Chris-May) or tweet him up at [@_chrismay](https://twitter.com/_chrismay) üëã.
I'm told putting this in the readme will not get me extra credit üòî.

Chris and I (and others) also organize [PyRVA](http://www.pyrva.org/), the Python User Group in Richmond, VA.
Feel free to join our group on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyRVAUserGroup/) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/fSGW7Jra4T)
